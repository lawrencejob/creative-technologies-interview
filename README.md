# Code test for Creative Technologies

I quite enjoyed the technical test but had to remind myself to not overcomplicate it with trying to address infinite inputs using Pipelines, streams, or ReactiveX. If I had more time, I would probably give it a try.

I tried to challenge myself to a few new techniques:
* Using Microsoft's DI library outside of ASP.Net (for which it was designed) in a Console app
* Using MSTest in a Console app (again, used to ASP.Net)
* Using pure Visual Studio Code (partly since my current company PC is a Mac)

It might mean that in a couple of areas, the code is less idiomatic VS + C# than usual, as the CLI and VS Code meant I was mostly writing from scratch.

Thanks, once again, for your consideration.
